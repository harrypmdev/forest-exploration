## Game Introduction Features

**Tutorial Choice**

- The game starts with a console prompt to the user to answer whether it is their first time playing. 
If so, a tutorial is printed. This ensures the user knows the goal of the game and is able to play properly.
- The console then prompts the user to press any key to continue. This ensures that only the tutorial is on screen
at this time and ensures a postive UX by not overloading the user with information.
- The tutorial can also be printed at any time throughout the game if the user enters the command 'tutorial'.

**Board Choice**

- After the tutorial choice prompt, the user is prompted to enter a board size they wish to play on.
- The user is presented with three abstracted choices: small, medium or large. They ensures the chosen board size
is always one of three tested choices and the board size is never too large or too small.
- The user's input is validated and the game does not move on until the user enters a valid option.

**Introduction Information**

- The game starts with introduction information being printed to the user. The first area description is printed
along with an extra line giving the context of the forest location of the game.
- This starts the user off with some information to respond to rather than leaving them to find the look 
command themselves.

## Features Yet to be Implemented

Forest Exploration is a finished and functional online text adventure. However, certain features could be implemented to improve the product in the future.

1. **Items that affect score:**
    - The game currently includes two ways the player can increase their score: killing enemies and healing sick animals.
    - One feature that could improve and the game and UX is another item type that increases the score directly. This would make finding items on the ground and on enemies more interesting.
2. **Enemy variations:**
    - All enemies in the game essentially function the same. They are instances of the Enemy class, with differing names and effect names but the same functionality.
    - The game would have more variety and provide a better UX if each enemy had different functionality.
    - This could be implemented by adding new enemies as children of the Enemy class.
3. **Item carrying capacity:**
    - The user starts the game with two items in their inventory and can find items in areas and on enemies throughout the game. 
    - Though the user is unlikely to accumulate a large amount of items, particularly on the small and medium board sizes, this can potentially happen and the user has to scroll to view all of their items. It may also be hard for the player to keep track of all their items.
    - A better UX could be provided if an item carrying capacity was introduced, so the player can only carry so many items at a time. The Item class could also have a weight attribute and the carrying capacity be limited by the sum of the all the items' weights. This would add an additional strategy element to gameplay.
    - An alternate solution to the same problem would be a more compact manner of printing the inventory to the user.
4. **Graphical UI:**
    - The game was created from the start to be a text-based adventure. However, it could be adapted to a simple UI with relatively little work. The console could remain for the player to enter their commands, but with the player's inventory and the board map viewable at all times on the page. 
    - Though this would change the nature of the product somewhat, it could potentially improve UX by allowing the user to better understand the location of their player and their items without clogging up the console with the 'map' and 'inventory' commands.

## Manual Testing 

###  Feature testing specific to mobile screen size

The site has been tested on mobile, tablet, and laptop/PC screen sizes. The following is testing done on an iPhone XR (414x896) screen simulator, though other mobile screen sizes have been tried.

|  Feature |  Testing action | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
Navbar|Click on burger|Menu opens|
Hero image| Click on 'CALL US NOW'|Phone app opens|
Services|Scroll through section|All pest divisons display vertically and are readable|
<br>

### Feature testing specific to tablet screen size and larger

The following is testing done on an iPad Air (1180x820) and regular desktop screen size, though other tablet and PC screen sizes have been tried.

|  Feature |  Testing action | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
Navbar|Hover over navbar links|Link colour temporarily changes and text enlarges|
Hero image|Hover over 'GET IN TOUCH'|Link temporarily fades in opacity|
||Click on 'GET IN TOUCH'|Contact us page opens|
'What do we help with' section|Hover over pest links|Links temporarily fade in opacity|
Reviews|Hover over individual reviews|Reviews temporarily fade in opacity, mouse changes to pointer to indicate reviews are links|
Services|Scroll through section|As many pest divisions as can fit display horizontally, then divisions display in rows vertically

### Feature testing generic to all screen sizes

The following testing should not change outcome based on screen size, but has been tried on phone, tablet and laptop/PC screen sizes regardless.

|  Feature |  Testing action | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
|Navbar |Click on menu link|Relevant page opens|
'What do we help with' section|Click pest links|Relevant part of services page opens|
Map|Attempt to move map frame|Embedded page functionality tells user to use two fingers|
Footer|Click social media links|Relevant social media page opens
Services |Click video|Embedded videos play correctly|
Query|Click submit with no data inputted|User told to fill required forms

## Bugs

|  Bug Number |  Problem | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
|1 | New items found in the game have unexpectedly low durability | Fixed
|2 |Services page images not appearing as circles | Fixed
3 | Services page videos not appearing correctly | Fixed
4 | WAVE evaluator shows skipped heading level on services.html | Fixed
||||

<br>

**1.**
- When testing the game in its development, I found some items I was acquiring were breaking quicker than I had intended them to. 
- For example, the 'sword' item was meant to have a durability of 5 uses, but was breaking after 1 use.
- I had implemented the item generation by creating a tuple of `HealthItem` objects that the `generate_items` function would iterate through.
- The generator was only creating references to the original tuple objects, which meant that once an item's durability had broken down, all subsequent items acquired of the same item type would retain the same durability. This meant that once the sword's durability had been worn down to 0 the first time, it broke at the first time its durability was checked on subsequent acquirings.
- I resolved the issue by changing the nature of item generation. The tuple in question (`HealthItem.ITEMS` in item.py) is now a two-dimensional tuple that holds the arguments for a possible `HealthItem`. A new `HealthItem` object is instantiated every time the `generate_items` function in item.py selects it for generation.

**2.**
- The images in the services.html pests flexbox sometimes appeared as either vertical or horizontal ovals despite the intention for them to be perfect circles.

**3.**
- The Youtube videos in the services.html pests flexbox appeared either on the left side of the flexbox only, or with large black bars on either side of the video if it was stretched to the full size of the flexbox.

**4.**
- The WAVE evaluator showed that the services page had skipped a heading level. This is an accessibility problem and bad practice. Headings should always run consecutively.
